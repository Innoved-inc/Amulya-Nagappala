            <h1 class="center">More About Zodiac</h1>
            <p class="float-right">My theme is Zodiac, meaning a group of 12
                constellations, each representing a section of a year. If you are born on a day of a certain
                Zodiac constellation, you will probably have at least one of their symbolic
                traits. The first, Capricorn, ranges from Dec. 22 to Jan. 21. It symbolizes hard work, straightforwardness, and stubbornness. Aquarius ranges from Jan. 22 to Feb. 21 and symbolizes innovativeness, admirableness, and eccentricity. Pisces ranges from Feb. 22 to Mar. 21 and symbolizes freedom, sensuality, and sensitivity.
