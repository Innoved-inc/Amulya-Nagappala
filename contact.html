                I chose this topic because I didn't know anything about Zodiac, and saw this as an opportunity to learn more. I want to build
                websites because I think it will be useful to know. My favorite part of making this website was choosing
                a topic because there were so many choices. The biggest challenge while making this website was learning
                to use code. I am going to make another website about Kalpana Chawla, the first Indian woman in space. I
                really enjoy making websites because it involves a lot of extra knowledge that you didn't think you needed.
